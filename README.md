# 👋 Hello 
 My name is Armin Khademian. I'm a passionate Front-end Developer who sees the web as a canvas. I believe that my job is about crafting seamless User Experiences (UX) rather than just writing code. Diving deep into Front-End Developing, I'm always building the next beautiful and performant interface. Let's make something amazing.
